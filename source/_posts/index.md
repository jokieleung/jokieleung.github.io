# Bio #



My name is Zujie Liang (梁祖杰). I am currently a Senior R&D AI Engineer at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en) (FinTech giant in China). Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree from [Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)](https://www.sysu.edu.cn) in 2022.

Now I am working on supply chain mining with LLMs, KG, and LLM-based Agents. My previous research broadly lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, with a focus on three areas: 1) multimodal bias reduction; 2) open-ended Conversational AI; 3) flexible/controllable text generation. I am very interested in understanding various human-centric properties of AI models, such as interpretability, generalization, causality, fairness and bias.

I'm always open to discussion or collaboration. Please check my <a href="attaches/Zujie_Liang_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for latest update and drop me an [E-mail](mailto:jokieleung@outlook.com) if you’re interested.
