# Bio #



My name is Zujie Liang (梁祖杰). I'm a third-year M.Phil. student at [Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)](https://www.sysu.edu.cn).

My previous research broadly lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, with a focus on three areas: 1) multimodal bias reduction; 2) open-ended Conversational AI; 3) flexible/controllable text generation. I am very interested in understanding various human-centric properties of AI models, such as interpretability, generalization, causality, fairness and bias.

I am open to discussion or collaboration. I am also actively looking for Ph.D. or job opportunities. Please check my <a href="attaches/jokie_resume_EN.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for latest update and drop me an [E-mail](mailto:jokieleung@outlook.com) if you’re interested.

- In my spare time, I maintain [Awesome-Visual-Question-Answering](https://github.com/jokieleung/awesome-visual-question-answering), which is a curated list of papers in the field of Visual QA (360+ stars now). 
- I'm a big fan of basketball/NBA. I am impressed by the application progress of AI in [basketball](https://becominghuman.ai/5-game-changing-computer-vision-applications-in-sports-5f02ec35529b), such as the [HomeCourt](https://www.homecourt.ai/) APP.
- [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) is the funniest TV series I have ever watched.
